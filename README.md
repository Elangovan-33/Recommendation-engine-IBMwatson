# Build a product recommendation engine with Watson Machine Learning and PixieApps

In this code pattern historical shopping data is used to build a recommendation engine with Spark and Watson Machine Learning. The model is then used in an interactive PixieApp in which a shopping basket is simulated and used to create a list of recommendations.

When you have completed this code patterns, you will understand how to:

* Use [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) in [IBM Watson Studio](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/)
* Build a recommendation model with SparkML and Watson Machine Learning to provide product recommendations for customers based on their purchase history
* Build an interactive dashboard using [PixieApps](https://pixiedust.github.io/pixiedust/pixieapps.html)

The intended audience is data scientists and developers interested in building, deploying and testing machine learning models from a Jupyter notebook with Watson Machine Learning.

**Sample output**

Here's an example of what the final app looks like

### 1. Setup project and data in Watson Studio

To complete this code pattern we'll need to do a few setup steps before creating our model. In Watson Studio we need to: create a project, add our patient data (which our model will be based on), upload our notebook, and provision a Watson Machine Learning service.

#### 1.1. Create a project in Watson Studio

* Log into IBM's [Watson Studio](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com). Once in, you'll land on the dashboard.

* Create a new project by clicking `+ New project` and choosing `Data Science`:

  ![studio project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/pattern-utils/master/watson-studio/new-project-data-science.png)

* Enter a name for the project name and click `Create`.

> **NOTE**: By creating a project in Watson Studio a free tier `Object Storage` service will be created in your IBM Cloud account. Select the `Free` storage type to avoid fees.

#### 1.2 Provision a Watson Machine Learning service

* Click on the navigation menu on the left (`☰`) to show additional options. Click on the `Watson Services` option.

   ![add asset](https://github.com/IBM/pattern-utils/raw/master/watson-studio/hamburger-menu-watson.png)

* From the overview page, click `+ Add service` on the top right and choose the `Machine Learning` service. Select the `Lite` plan to avoid fees.

* Once provisioned, you should see the service listed in the `Watson Services` overview page. **Select the service by opening the link in a new tab.**  We're now in the IBM Cloud tool, where we will create service credentials for our now Watson Machine Learning service. Follow the numbered steps in the image below. **We'll be using these credentials in Step 2, so keep them handy!**.

   ![wml credentials](https://github.com/IBM/pattern-utils/raw/master/watson-studio/credentials-wml.png)

* **TIP:** You can now go back the project via the navigation menu on the left (`☰`).

   ![add asset](https://github.com/IBM/pattern-utils/raw/master/watson-studio/hamburger-menu-project.png)

#### 1.3 Create a notebook in Watson Studio

The notebook we'll be using can be viewed in [`notebooks/wml-product-recommendation-engine.ipynb`](notebooks/wml-product-recommendation-engine.ipynb), and a completed version can be found in [`examples/wml-product-recommendation-engine-complete.ipynb`](examples/wml-product-recommendation-engine-complete.ipynb).

* From the new project `Overview` panel, click `+ Add to project` on the top right and choose the `Notebook` asset type. Fill in the following information:

  * Select the `From URL` tab. [1]
  * Enter a `Name` for the notebook and optionally a description. [2]
  * Under `Notebook URL` provide the following url: [https://github.com/IBM/product-recommendation-with-watson-ml/blob/master/notebooks/wml-product-recommendation-engine.ipynb](https://github.com/IBM/product-recommendation-with-watson-ml/blob/master/notebooks/wml-product-recommendation-engine.ipynb) [3]
  * For `Runtime` select the `Spark Python 3.6` option. [4]

  ![add notebook](https://github.com/IBM/pattern-utils/raw/master/watson-studio/notebook-create-url-spark-py36.png)

* **TIP:** Once successfully imported, the notebook should appear in the `Notebooks` section of the `Assets` tab.

### 2. Create and deploy a predictive model with Watson Studio

Now that we're in our Notebook editor, we can start to create our predictive model by stepping through the notebook.

#### 2.1 Start stepping through the notebook

* Click the &#9654; `Run` button to start stepping through the notebook.

* In cell *2. Load and explore data* we call PixieDust's `display()` method to view the data interactively.

* Keep stepping through the code, pausing on each step to read the code and see the output for the opertion we're performing. At the end of *Step 3* we'll have used the [K-means Clustering](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-clustering.html#k-means) algorithm on Spark ML to create a model. This model associates every customer to a cluster based on their shopping history.

#### 2.2 Save the model

The gist of the next two steps is to use the [Watson Machine Learning Python client](https://wml-api-pyclient.mybluemix.net/) to persist and deploy the model we just created.

* At the beginning of Step *5. Persist model*, before we deploy our model, we need up update the cell with credentials from our Watson Machine Learning service. (Remember that from [Step 1.2 Provision a Watson Machine Learning service](#12-provision-a-watson-machine-learning-service)?)

* Update the `wml_credentials` variable below. Copy and paste the entire credential dictionary, which can be found on the _Service Credentials_ tab of the Watson Machine Learning service instance created on the IBM Cloud.

   ![credentials-in-nb](doc/source/images/credentials-in-nb.png)

* Keep stepping through the code, pausing on each step to read the code and see the output for the opertion we're performing. At the end of *Step 4* we'll have used the Watson Machine Learning service to persist and save our recommendation model! :tada:

#### 2.3 Deploy the model

* Now let's run *Step 5. Deploy model to the IBM cloud* of the notebook. Deploy our model so we can have an endpoint to score data against.

  ![score-url-in-nb](doc/source/images/score-url-in-nb.png)

* In *Step 6. Create product recommendations* we create functions that query the database to find the most popular items for a cluster and calculate the recommendations based on a given cluster. This produces a list of recommended items based on the products and quantities in a user's cart, which uses Watson Machine Learning to calculate the cluster based on the shopping cart contents.

* Lastly, in *Step 6.1 Test product recommendations model*, these functions can now be used in a PixieApp to create an interactive dashboard.

## Example Output

Here we add some products to our cart, and get some recommendations:
